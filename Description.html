    Undo and redo? - Easy!</p>
  <p><a href="#">Download sample code.</a></p>
  <p>
    In our recent .NET 2.0 GUI project our client ingenuously asked us to implement
    undo and redo facility. Nothing unusual in nowadays, however it's still not the
    easiest thing in the world to implement.</p>
  <p>
    Naturally you want to have this feature for a free. You do not want to invest too
    much time to support it. We had no much time to implement this "sugar" also. I know,
    I know, this is important for a user, however when you're facing a big project with
    a lot of logic to be implemented in short time you're starting to think it would
    be nice to have undo and redo logic that works independently (at least almost
    independently) on business logic.</p>
  <p>
    Thus, what's that place where we could plug this service? - Exactly! - It's data
    binding layer.</p>
  <p>
    When you're binding your data to controls the "Type Descriptor Architecture" is
    used to retrieve and update the data. Fortunately this architecture is allowing
    us to create a data wrapper (ICustomTypeDescriptor). Such wrapper should track
    property modifications of the data object thus providing undo and redo service. 
    In short that's all, other are technical details.</p>
  <p>
    Let's look at how undo and redo service goes into the action. Instead of:</p>
  <div class="code-block">  bindingSource.DataSource = data;</div>
  <p>you have to write:</p>
  <div class="code-block">  bindingSource.DataSource = Create-UndoRedo-Wrapper(data);</div>
  <p>
    There should also be a class to collect and track actions. User should create an 
    instance of this class to implement the simplest form of code with undo and redo
    support:</p>
  <div class="code-block">  // Create UndoRedoManager.
  undoRedoManager = new UndoRedoManager();

  // Create undo and redo wrapper around the data object.
  // Bind controls.
  dataBindingSource.DataSource =
    new UndoRedoTypeDescriptor(data, undoRedoManager);</div>
  <p>
    Now turn our attention to the implementation of the undo and redo mechanism. There
    are two types in the core: UndoRedoManager and IAction. The first
    one is to track actions, the later one is to define undo and redo action.
    UndoRedoManager performs either "Do/Redo", or "Undo" operations over IAction 
    instances. We have provided
    two useful implementations of the IAction interface:
    UndoRedoTypeDescriptor - wrapper around an object that tracks property changes, 
    and UndoRedoList&lt;T&gt; - wrapper around the IList&lt;T&gt; that tracks collection
    modifications. Users may create their implementations of the IAction to handle 
    other undo and redo activities.</p>
  <p>
    We have created a sample application to show undo and redo in action. You can download
    it from <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
